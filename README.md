Hey There 
Welcome to classroom where we are building a app to bridge the online and offline classroom.
Fetch and pull main branch changes.

Create branch before you start working on your task, using the following folder convention:

feature/ - For Any new feature in the game
fix/ - For any kind of fix
change/ - Modifications on the already existing features
prototype/ - For any prototype the team needs to do
TBD
Commit as many changes as you can.

Review your commit changes before actually committing them.

Once you’re done with your task, update your branch with main.

Fix any merge conflicts that may appear.

Create a Pull Request to be reviewed and accepted by the team.

If it’s a prototype the branch can be left over, if desired.
