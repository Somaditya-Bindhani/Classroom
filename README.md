Hey There 
Welcome to classroom where we are building a app to bridge the online and offline classroom.
Fetch and pull main branch changes.

Create branch before you start working on your task, using the following folder convention:

<p> 1 . feature/ - For Any new feature in the game </p>
<p> 2 . fix/ - For any kind of fix </p>
<p> 3 . change/ - Modifications on the already existing features </p>
<p> 4 . prototype/ - For any prototype the team needs to do </p>
<p> 5 . TBD </p>
<p> 6 . Commit as many changes as you can. </p>

Review your commit changes before actually committing them.

Once you’re done with your task, update your branch with main.

Fix any merge conflicts that may appear.

Create a Pull Request to be reviewed and accepted by the team.

If it’s a prototype the branch can be left over, if desired.
